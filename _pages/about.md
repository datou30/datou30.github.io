Self introduction
======
Hi, my name is Zhengyang Hu. I'm a first year phd student from [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering ](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interest includes deep learning, information theory, computer vision, and machine learning. Before joining in the HKU, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanchao Yang](https://yanchaoyang.github.io/) from [Institude of Data Science](https://datascience.hku.hk/) and [Prof. Kaibin Huang](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~huangkb/) from [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), the University of Hong Kong.
You can find my CV here: [Zhengyang Hu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_ZhengyangHu.pdf).
